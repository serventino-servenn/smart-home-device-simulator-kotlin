# Smart Home Device-Simulator-kotlin
Smart Home Device Simulator -  [Kotlin classes and objects challenge](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-classes-and-objects#10) from Android Basics.

This project is a solution to the "Classes and Objects" challenge from the Android Basics with Jetpack Compose course. It demonstrates how to apply object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to simulate smart home devices.The goal is to implement additional behavior and control logic in the classes and test them in the main function.

### Additional Behavior:
- Add printDeviceInfo() function to the SmartDevice class
- Add decreaseVolume() and previousChannel() functions to the SmartTVDevice class
- Add decreaseBrightness() function in the SmartLightDevice class
- implement decreaseTvVolume() changeTvChannelToPrevious() decreaseLightBrightness()
